# Vimlord's Vimrc

## Introduction

Vim (run as `vim`) is a text editor that extends the concepts of the Vi editor.
It provides users with the ability to edit files using built-in commands and
modes to chain together many small edits. Vim can be configured using a file
known as "vimrc", which is typically written to a hidden file `.vimrc` in the
user's home directory (AKA `~/.vimrc`).

The purpose of this repository is to provide my personal "vimrc" file with
comments provided to explain what various commands mean and why I added them.
The goodness or validity of the contents of the file are subjective and YMMV.

## Installation

The installation assumes you're running or emulating Linux/Unix.

- If you're entirely replacing, write the `vimrc` file to `.vimrc` in your home directory (`~/.vimrc`).
- If you're modifying your existing `vimrc`, feel free to take snippets of code from my `vimrc` to add to yours.
